        <h2>KnobHill Studios</h2>
        <p>
            KnobHill Studios was founded in 2022 with a focus on precision craftsmanship, blending traditional
            woodworking with modern technology. We design and build high-quality cutting boards, furniture, custom woodwork,
            and laser-engraved pieces - all made from sustainably sourced, and locally harvested wood species whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside our woodworking, we produce our own plant-based cutting board and wood utensil wax & oil, 
            formulated to protect and extend the life of any natural wood kitchen items, or any other natural wood
            items you can think of. Whether you're looking for a durable, handcrafted board or a natural way to maintain 
            it, we have you covered there.

            <p>
                Keep your wooden kitchenware in top condition with our plant-based oils and waxes. Designed to protect and 
                extend the life of your cutting boards and utensils, our conditioning formulas keep your wood nourished and 
                looking beautiful. Our oils and waxes contain zero petroleum products and were not manufactured with solvents.

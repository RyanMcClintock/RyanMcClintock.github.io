            San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
            Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, 
            educate, and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge... 
            and that is priceless.”
        </blockquote>
